## Project Overview
In this project I will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. A smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.
A copy of the data set can be downloaded [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/October/5bc0f2d2_projectdata-nyse/projectdata-nyse.csv).
